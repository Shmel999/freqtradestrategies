## Organization !heading

All Strategies go into the strategy folder.

Backtesting data is from [NFI](https://github.com/iterativv/NostalgiaForInfinity). So currently only limited to kucoin and binance. Timeframes only have 5m , 15m, 1h, 1d. If you need more, I am willing to fork NFIData and add more timeframes. And maybe more exchanges.
